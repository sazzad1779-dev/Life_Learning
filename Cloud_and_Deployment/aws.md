# AWS Cloud Essentials

### Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was started in 2006 to help companies avoid the high cost and effort of buying and managing their servers. Before AWS, businesses had to set up physical computers and storage to run websites or apps, which took time and money. AWS came into the market to solve this problem by offering these resources over the internet.


### AWS and Its Core Capabilities
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud platform offered by Amazon that lets people and companies use IT services like storage, servers, and databases through the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical computers, you can "rent" these services online and only pay for what you use.

AWS offers over 200 services including:

- EC2: Virtual servers for running applications.
- S3: Object storage for files and media.
- RDS: Managed relational databases.
- Lambda: Run code without managing servers.

### Understanding AWS Fundamentals

To effectively use AWS, you must understand its foundational concepts:
1. Regions
AWS operates in multiple geographical regions worldwide. Each region consists of one or more data centers and is designed to provide low-latency services to nearby users.

2. Availability Zones (AZs)
Each region includes multiple Availability Zones, which are isolated data centers. These zones provide high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring your application remains operational even if one zone fails.

3. Global Network Infrastructure
AWS has a global network of high-speed fiber connections linking its data centers. This infrastructure enables optimized performance, reduced latency, and better disaster recovery options.
