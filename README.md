Today 05/09/2025, I'm revising my carrier.

## Learning points:
1. Core Foundations:
    1. Data Structure and Algorithms:
    2. Programming:
    3. Math & Stats:
2. Low-level System Design:
3. High-level System Design:
4. Data engineering:
    1. Tabular Data EDA
    2. Image Data Analysis
    3. Text Data Analysis
        - Structured
        - Unstructured
5. Model Architecture:
    1. Traditional ML
    2. Deep Learning
    3. NLP
        - LSTM
        - Traditional algorithm
        - Transformers 
        - Single Expert Architecture
        - Multi Expert Architecture (MOE)
6. Model Pre-Training:

7. Model Finetuning:
    1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
    2. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
        - DPO
        - PPO
7. Model Inference & Optimization:
    1. KV cache
    2. Quantization

8. Model Evaluation:

9.  APIs:
    - OAuth2, JWT, SSO
    - API Gateway & Rate limiting
10. MLOps:
11. Application Monitoring and Observability:
    1. Infrastructure & System Monitoring
    2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
    3. Logs & Event Monitoring
    4. Error Tracking & Alerts
    5. LM/AI-Specific Monitoring
     ```   
        Prometheus + Grafana → industry standard, open-source.
        Prometheus = metrics collection.
        Grafana = visualization dashboards.
        Works well for servers, containers (K8s), and microservices.
   
    Datadog (SaaS, easy to use, strong integrations).
    ```

12. Cloud & Deployment:


13. Web Interface
14. RAG System
15. Agent System
16. Multi Agent System
