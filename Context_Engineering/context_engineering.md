### How Long Contexts Fail

##### Managing Your Context is the Key to Successful Agents

* [Context Poisoning: When a hallucination makes it into the context](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html#context-poisoning)

  *Context Poisoning is when a hallucination or other error makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced.*
* [Context Distraction: When the context overwhelms the training](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html#context-distraction)

  *Context Distraction is when a context grows so long that the model over-focuses on the context, neglecting what it learned during training.*
* [Context Confusion: When superfluous context influences the response](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html#context-confusion)

  *Context Confusion is when superfluous content in the context is used by the model to generate a low-quality response.*
* [Context Clash: When parts of the context disagree](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html#context-clash)

  *Context Clash is when you accrue new information and tools in your context that conflicts with other information in the context*
