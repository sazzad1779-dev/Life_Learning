## What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a powerful and innovative approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP). RAG comes to solve  llm limitationsâ€”outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and generic responses. It enhances LLMs by integrating them with external data sources and  enables AI systems to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

LLMs are powerful but come with inherent limitations:

* Limited knowledge: LLMs can only generate responses based on their training data, which may be outdated or lack domain-specific information.
* Hallucinations: These models sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
* Generic responses: Without access to external sources, LLMs may provide vague or imprecise answers.

RAG addresses these issues by allowing models to retrieve up-to-date and domain-specific information from structured and unstructured data sources, such as databases, documentation, and APIs.

The basic structure of RAG involves three key components: `indexing`, `retrieval`, and `generation`.

#### Indexing
This step involves several key steps: chunking, embedding, and storing embeddings in a database .
**Chunking**:
Chunking refers to dividing documents into smaller sections or chunks. Each chunk is a segment of the document that can be independently processed and searched. This helps in handling large documents by focusing on relevant sections rather than the entire document.

Benefits:

- Improves search efficiency.
- Enhances the relevance of retrieved information.
- Allows more precise targeting of specific information within large documents.

**Embeddings for Chunks**:
For each text chunk, then need to create text embeddings, which are numeric representations of the text in the vector space. Words with similar meanings are expected to be in closer proximity or have a shorter distance in the vector space. 

**Storing Embeddings in a Vector Database**:
After creating embeddings for each chunk, they are stored in a vector database. This database allows efficient searching and retrieval of similar documents based on their embeddings.

Vector Database:

- Stores high-dimensional vectors representing the chunks.
- Supports fast similarity searches using methods like Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and FAISS.
