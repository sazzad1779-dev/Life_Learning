# AWS Cloud Essentials

### Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was started in 2006 to help companies avoid the high cost and effort of buying and managing their servers. Before AWS, businesses had to set up physical computers and storage to run websites or apps, which took time and money. AWS came into the market to solve this problem by offering these resources over the internet.


### AWS and Its Core Capabilities
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud platform offered by Amazon that lets people and companies use IT services like storage, servers, and databases through the internet. Instead of buying and maintaining physical computers, you can "rent" these services online and only pay for what you use.

AWS offers over 200 services including:

- EC2: Virtual servers for running applications.
- S3: Object storage for files and media.
- RDS: Managed relational databases.
- Lambda: Run code without managing servers.

### Understanding AWS Fundamentals

To effectively use AWS, you must understand its foundational concepts:
1. Regions
AWS operates in multiple geographical regions worldwide. Each region consists of one or more data centers and is designed to provide low-latency services to nearby users.

2. Availability Zones (AZs)
Each region includes multiple Availability Zones, which are isolated data centers. These zones provide high availability and fault tolerance, ensuring your application remains operational even if one zone fails.

3. Global Network Infrastructure
AWS has a global network of high-speed fiber connections linking its data centers. This infrastructure enables optimized performance, reduced latency, and better disaster recovery options.


AWS is a preferred choice for DevOps teams due to its flexibility, automation capabilities, and scalability. Here's why:

1. On-Demand Resources
With AWS, you don‚Äôt need to set up your computers or servers. You can quickly use services like storage, databases, and virtual machines over the internet. It is like turning on a switch, use what you need, when you need it.

2. Pay-as-You-Go Pricing
AWS doesn't ask you to buy anything upfront. You are charged only for the time and the amount of services you use. If you use a server for 2 hours, you only pay for 2 hours. This helps save money and avoid waste.

3. Global Infrastructure
AWS has data centres across the globe. So, whether your users are in India, the US, or Europe your app can reach them quickly. Also, if your business grows and you need more power or storage, AWS can easily scale up without downtime.

4. Reliability and Performance
With features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and data replication, AWS ensures minimal downtime and high application performance.

5. One Platform for All Your Cloud Services
AWS provides a unified console where you can manage computing, storage, networking, databases, analytics, machine learning, and security all in one place.

### How AWS Delivers Cloud Services
Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivers cloud computing through a network of globally distributed data centers connected by high-speed fiber. These centers host a wide range of services from storage and compute power to databases and machine learning that users can access on demand via the internet.

Whether you are a startup or an enterprise, AWS allows you to build and run applications without managing physical servers. AWS handles:

- Server maintenance
- Security patching
- Resource scaling
- High availability.

### What is Amazon VPC?
With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.


Ports & Protocols: e.g., HTTP uses TCP port 80, HTTPS uses TCP port 443.

Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls:

Stateful remembers connections (like AWS Security Groups).

Stateless checks each packet independently (like AWS NACLs).

Hands-on

On your computer, list open ports:
Linux/Mac: sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
Windows: netstat -ano | find "LISTEN"

5Ô∏è‚É£ NAT & VPN Basics

Concepts

NAT (Network Address Translation): Lets many private IPs share a single public IP.

VPN (Virtual Private Network): Creates an encrypted tunnel between networks or a device and a network.

Hands-on

If you use a home router, log in and look for its NAT table or port-forwarding settings to see NAT in action.

‚úÖ Goal for Stage 1

You should be able to:

Explain CIDR notation and design subnets.

Read or create a basic routing table.

Describe how DNS resolves a domain.

Understand firewall rules and common ports.

Explain how NAT and VPNs work.

Would you like me to provide a 1-week study schedule for Stage 1 (e.g., daily topics and small tasks), or would you prefer to start with a deep dive into one of these concepts like IP addressing first?

Nice ‚Äî let‚Äôs go very deep on Stage 1 (core networking fundamentals). I‚Äôll explain concepts, show worked calculations (digit-by-digit), give examples you can practice, and list the commands/tools to use. Ready? üöÄ

1 ‚Äî Network models (very short, important mapping)

OSI (7 layers) ‚Äî Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical.

TCP/IP (4 layers) ‚Äî Application, Transport (TCP/UDP), Internet (IP), Link (Ethernet/802.11).
Mapping is useful: IP lives at the Internet/Network layer, ARP & switches at Data Link, TCP/UDP at Transport.
