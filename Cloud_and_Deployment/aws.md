## Introduction to AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) was started in 2006 to help companies avoid the high cost and effort of buying and managing their servers. Before AWS, businesses had to set up physical computers and storage to run websites or apps, which took time and money. AWS came into the market to solve this problem by offering these resources over the internet.
