## What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a powerful and innovative approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP). RAG comes to solve  llm limitationsâ€”outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and generic responses. It enhances LLMs by integrating them with external data sources and  enables AI systems to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

LLMs are powerful but come with inherent limitations:

* Limited knowledge: LLMs can only generate responses based on their training data, which may be outdated or lack domain-specific information.
* Hallucinations: These models sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
* Generic responses: Without access to external sources, LLMs may provide vague or imprecise answers.

RAG addresses these issues by allowing models to retrieve up-to-date and domain-specific information from structured and unstructured data sources, such as databases, documentation, and APIs.

The basic structure of RAG involves three key components: `indexing`, `retrieval`, and `generation`.
